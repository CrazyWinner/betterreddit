# BetterReddit

Reddit on browser is a pain in the ass to use. It slows down as you scroll down and after 5-10 minutes of scrolling it becomes unresponsive. This extension aims to solve that. As you scroll it removes the posts you can't see and insert them if you scroll back. 
Note: Search in page function on browsers won't work because posts won't be there.
